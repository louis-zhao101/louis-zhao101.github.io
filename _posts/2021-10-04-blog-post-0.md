The goal of this blog post is to create a tutorial on generating a visualization for the penguins dataset

### Reading the Dataset

First let's read in our dataset and take a look at the first 5 rows to get a better sense of what it looks like

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
penguins.head()
```
{% include penguin_df.html %}

### Generating the Visualization

It seems like we have some descriptive data for our penguins (Culmen Lenghth, Culmen Depth ...). Something interesting we can visualize is the distribution of weights for our penguins. We can visualize this with a histogram of our Body Mass (g) variable. To create this we will use seaborn's histplot function.

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.histplot(data = penguins, 
             x = 'Body Mass (g)')
```
![base_hist.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/base_hist.png)

This is a great plot of getting a quick introduction to the distribution of weights for our penguins. We can change some parameters to adjust the bin size, title and color of our plot. 

```python
new_hist = sns.histplot(data = penguins, 
             x = 'Body Mass (g)', 
             color = 'orange', 
             bins = 20)
new_hist.set(title = 'Distribution of Penguin Weights')
new_hist.get_figure().savefig('new_hist.png')
```
![new_hist.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/new_hist.png)

In this new plot, we have a different shade, smaller bin sizes (more total bins) to show a more refined distribution of our data and a title that describes the overall goal of our plot. This completes our short tutorial on creating a visualization in python on the penguins dataset and uploading it to a blog post on Github through Jekyll.
